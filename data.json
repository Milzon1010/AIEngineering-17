    "text": "Welcome to our interactive guide on teaching computers to see! In this guide, you'll learn the basics of image recognition, understand what Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are, and see how to build a simple image recognition model using Keras. This guide is designed for beginner AI engineering students, so we'll keep things simple and easy to understand."

    "title": "What are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)?",
    "text": "A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning model that is particularly well-suited for image recognition tasks. Think of it as a series of filters that can detect patterns in images, such as edges, shapes, and textures. These filters are learned automatically from the data, which makes CNNs very powerful.",

      {
        "name": "Convolutional Layer",
        "description": "This is the core building block of a CNN. It applies a set of filters to the input image to create feature maps that highlight specific patterns."

      {
        "name": "Pooling Layer",
        "description": "This layer reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, which helps to reduce the computational complexity of the model and control overfitting."
